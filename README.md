# AINE

AINE is an open source narrator engine for visual and interactive storytelling. It was initially created as a solution for RPG- and story authors without or with little programming knowledge, who wanted to create an interactive experience. AINE excels at being easy to use, visually impressive, and easy to customize.

The current version is based on Adobe Flash, and an HTML5 version has been planed. The engine uses its own coding, inspired by JSON, which is an intuitive mix of markup language and script language, allowing authors to create their vision through as little and simple code as possible, while also having access to a wide variety of events and interactions. The engine has a plug-in system implemented which makes it very easy to extend the Engine language with your own functions, giving advanced programmers access to all the power of ActionScript 3, for the Flash based version.
