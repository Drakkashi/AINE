# AINE

AINE is an open source narrator engine for visual and interactive storytelling. It was initially created as a solution for RPG- and story authors without or with little programming knowledge, who wanted to create an interactive experience. AINE excels at being easy to use, visually impressive, and easy to customize.

The current version is based on Adobe Flash, and an HTML5 version is being planed. The Engine has its own code language, which is an intuitive mix of markup- and script language. The Engine has a module system implemented which makes it very easy to extend the Engine language with custom functions, giving adept programmers access to all the power of ActionScript 3, for the Adobe Flash version.

The Engine comes with a customizable Graphical User Interface (GUI) for games made with it, though there is no GUI for editing. Working with the Engine is purely done through code. This was a deliberate design choice, as a GUI which distance the author from the actual code is restricting. A shared platform means advanced programmers can more easily assist new authors, while the new authors can also more easily move on to more advanced programming without first having to unlearn the GUI.

It has been a challenge to design an Engine with a low entry berrier and learning curve, while also supplying functions for advanced usage.
